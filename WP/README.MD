I created a window with a text editor, few buttons, added and changed it's fucntions.
For example: I've disabled the original exit button and changed it to other button called "Exit".
I had problem with resizing the window with all objects in it. So I got a cancer because of this.
Other disease was LaTeX, and as I was using this for the first time, I did not know how to save the file itself as a PDF. 
That's why I feel like an autist.
