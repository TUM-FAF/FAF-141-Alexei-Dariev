In my program I've added a menu which has 3 elements called Exit, Draw and About which were declared in resources.rc and resource.h files and added it's functons in main.cpp. (created in WM CREATE and then added functions in WM COMMAND.) Then I've attached hotkeys using RegisterHotKey and giving the parameters of MOD CONTROL(to use control) and the id of the key, so we got hotkeys for EXIT(CTRL+E), Draw ellipse(CTRL+F), Draw line (CTRL+L). To attach the functions to the hotkeys I've put the same functions as in WM COMMAND to the WM HOTKEY case.The dialog box is actualy called from the top meny by clicking on the "About" button in the "Info" Submenu. The case for the dialog box was declared(IDD ABOUTBOX) in resousce.h and resources.rc and was used in case WM INITDIALOG and called in ID STUFF GO case(where DialogBox function was used). Our DialogBox prints out our message with an OK button.
Next thing was the "Scrollbars" which I made to change the color of the drawn circle and write the actual code of a color in HEX and a number code of Red, Green or Blue saturation. To create scroll bars I declared them like "hGreenScroll,hBlueScroll,hRedScroll" and set it's parameters. To initialize a scroll range i used a SetScrollRange function and introduced its parameters with identifier of a window (hGreenScroll and etc.) and put it's range wth nxMin and nxMax parameters. After this I used a SetScrollPos to introduce initial positions of our scroll bars(nxPos parameter in our case its 127).To process our messages from scrollbars we used WM HSCROLL case with other subcases like SB PAGERIGHT SB PAGELEFT and so on with nxPos as a variable. To connect our scrollbars with our "events" I used GetDlgItem and CreateSolidBrush functios and applied variables "red, green, blue"(for redrawable circle)( for textbox we used defined "cases" like ID EDITGREEN, ID EDITBLUE, ID EDITRED in our header file). To find out which scrollbar was used we use utilize WM HSCROLL and give it the necessary amount of parameters. The identifier of the window were the movement was made is stored in lParam.
To print the HEX Code of a color in the textbox I used a sprintf function.
Other thing i've added was the Listbox(with hwndListbox and IDM LISTBOX declared) with attaching some strings(SendMessage(hwndListbox)) to it from a textbox(with hwndNew and IDM NEW declared) which are added by a button(with hwndAddButton IDM ADD declared) and removed by a rightclick(for this I used WM CONTEXTMENU with 2 if statements and one of the parameters(LB DELETESTRING)).
To add a Cursor and Icon for our program I've attached my .ico and .cur file in resources.rc file and then changed the basic parameters of a window structure like wincl.hIcon, wincl.hIconSm, wincl.hCursor (with fucntions LoadCursor and LoadIcon).
