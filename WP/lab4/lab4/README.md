*Windows Timer. Animation.*

##Contents:

 * Windows timer
 
###What have I done
I have created a Windows application that can create an animation based on Windows timer which 
involves more drawn objects. You can increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from
keyboard. Also, you can add objects (balls) with mouse. These balls change their color when they are called.
And resolved the problem with flikering screen.
