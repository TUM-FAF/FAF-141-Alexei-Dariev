# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #3


## Title
Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

## Contents
* Mouse
* Device context
* GDI Primitives
  * Line
  * Curve
  * Plane
  * Bitmap image
* Bezier curve

### Laboratory work Requirements:
  - for _Basic Level_ (grade 5 || 6) you should be able to:
    * Draw 5 lines of different colors and weights
    * Draw 2 Bezier curves
    * Draw 4 plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
    * Draw 2 different objects using mouse
  - for _Normal Level_ (grade 7 || 8) you should be able to:
    * Realize the tasks from _Basic Level_.
    * Draw a custom bitmap image 
    * Fill 2 object with gradient 
    * Draw a Bezier curve using mouse
  - for _Advanced Level_ (grade 9 || 10) you should be able to:
    * Realize the tasks from _Normal Level_.
    * Zoom in and out application working area using keyboard 
    * Use mouse as an eraser (choose 1 option):
      * delete objects using mouse clicking
      * eraser of a fixed width
      * eraser with adjustable width
  - for _Bonus Point Tasks_ :
    * Realize the task with mouse eraser for all 3 cases listed above. In order to choose one of them, add 3 buttons/icons or check boxes.

##Implemented tasks:
a.	Was created area for drawing.
b.	Also was created 2 objects with gradient.
c.	Tools and Shapes which will be used to draw, such as:
   *	**Pen** tool will draw a continuous line with the stroke weight equal to 1.
   *	**Line** tool will draw a straight line using the mouse button.
   *	**Ellipse** tool will draw an ellipse using the mouse button.
   *	**Rectangle** tool will draw a rectangleusing the mouse button.
   *	**Bezier.** The Bezier curve can be drawn using mouse,by clicking and draging.
   *  **Eraser** which will erase with static size.
d.	Custom bitmap image : a custom image was attached

##Conclusions
In this laboratory work I've created a window with different adjustable primitives. Also now I can create my own "Paint" and add more fucntions to it.
